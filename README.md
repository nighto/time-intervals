It's mission is simple: you input a start time, eg. 08:00, an end time, eg. 12:00, and an interval, eg. 00:15, and it will output all the intervals, including start and end time. In this example, the result would be:

08:00, 08:15, 08:30, 08:45, 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45, 10:00, 10:15, 10:30, 10:45, 11:00, 11:15, 11:30, 11:45, 12:00
